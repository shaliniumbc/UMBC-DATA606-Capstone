## Background

### What is it about?
This project focuses on a set of time series analysis and machine learning models specifically, ARIMA(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Averages), SARIMA(Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average),  Random Forest, and Support Vector Regressor applied for predicting stock prices. Financial markets are quite complex and typically volatile therefore, accurate prediction about stock prices tends to be quite hard. The general objective is to create predictive models capable of forecasting future stock prices based on historical information. This project aims to determine whether or not applying advanced algorithms in machine learning can enhance the accuracy of forecasting performance to provide helpful information for investors, traders, and analysts.


### Why does it matter?

For investors and traders, stock price prediction is extremely important because it provides them with a sound basis for good decisions on when to buy or sell assets so that their financial strategy can be optimized while reducing risks. There is an enormous amount of data that is marketable, and because of such high dynamism and non-linearity, it remains highly challenging to predict stock prices. Traditional methods currently used can often fall through in capturing the minute complexities of market behaviour. To these ends, this project aims to use advanced predictive models such as ARIMA model,Random Forest and Support Vector Regressor, with promise established in other domains to serve as a more reliable source of prediction for stock price movements.

This project is significant in terms of its potential to:
-	Improve modern techniques in time series analysis and machine learning that are used to make accurate predictions about the stock price.
- Improve risk management and decision-making for the financial market participants.
-	Contribute to the still-growing field of financial analytics, and the applications of machine learning in the finance industry.


### Research Questions?

1. Can historical stock prices and financial data be used to accurately predict future stock market trends?
2. Which time series analysis model performs the best in terms of accuracy for stock market prediction?
3. Can feature selection improve the performance of predictive models in stock market analysis?

5. Time Series Decomposition:

- Time Series Decomposition are divided into three components Trend, Seasonality and Residual

- **Trend:** The long-term movement or direction in the data over time.

- **Seasonality:** Regular pattern or cycle in the data that repeats over a specific period.

- **Residual:** Random variations or fluctuations in the data that cannot be attributed to trend or seasonality.

### ARIMA


![image](https://github.com/shaliniumbc/UMBC-DATA606-Capstone/blob/main/docs/images/arima.png)


a) Standardized Residuals Plot (Top-Left):

- Shows the residuals (errors) over time.
- Residuals appear to be randomly distributed around zero.

b) Histogram Plus Estimated Density (Top-Right):

- Compares the residuals to a normal distribution.
- The green curve represents a standard normal distribution (N(0,1)), while the orange curve represents the actual residual density (KDE).

c) Normal Q-Q Plot (Bottom-Left):

- Compares the quantiles of residuals to a standard normal distribution.
- Points lie close to the red diagonal line, indicating that the residuals follow a normal distribution.

d) Correlogram (Bottom-Right):

- Plots the autocorrelation of residuals.

** Autocorrelation**

![image](https://github.com/shaliniumbc/UMBC-DATA606-Capstone/blob/main/docs/images/plotting.png)

- The autocorrelation plot shows that the current values are strongly related to past values. This means the data has patterns like trends or seasonality, which are important for building predictive models.

**Partial Autocorrrelation**

![image](https://github.com/shaliniumbc/UMBC-DATA606-Capstone/blob/main/docs/images/partial.png)


- This partial autocorrelation graph shows strong relationships at lower lags (e.g., lag 1 and 2) and minimal influence at higher lags. It helps determine the order of the AR (Auto-Regressive) component in time series models like ARIMA.


### Support Vector Regressor

![image](https://github.com/shaliniumbc/UMBC-DATA606-Capstone/blob/main/docs/images/svr.png)

- This graph compares the actual stock prices of Bank of America (BAC) with the predicted values generated by the Support Vector Regressor (SVR). The close alignment between the orange (predicted) and blue (actual) lines demonstrates the model's high accuracy in forecasting stock prices over time.

### Model Performance Table

![image](https://github.com/shaliniumbc/UMBC-DATA606-Capstone/blob/main/docs/images/compare.png)

- The table compares the performance of different predictive models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² scores. The SVR model achieves the best performance with the lowest MSE (0.063021) and the highest RÂ² score (0.998059), indicating its superior predictive accuracy compared to the othe r models.


## STREAMLIT WEB APP

- I created a web app development using Streamlit to predict stock market trends using the SVR Model.

### CHALLENGES

1. Unpredictable Market Factors:
   External influences like economic events, political disruptions, or natural disasters can be highly erratic and create challenges for model 
    accuracy in stock market prediction.

2. Lack of Interpretability:
Machine learning models are often opaque, making it difficult to trace their reasoning or correct biases, which can limit trust in their predictions.

3. Data Sources:
Traditional data like financial reports may be insufficient for accurate predictions, while integrating new sources like social media can offer insights into market sentiment.

### FUTURE WORK

1. Incorporating Additional Data sources:
   
To improve the accuracy of stock market prediction future work could involve incorporating additional data sources such as economic indicators (or) social media sentiment analysis. Additional model evaluation like conducting back testing to evalute model peeformance under diffeent market conditios & Enhancing model Robustness.

2. More Advanced Models:
   
Apply more complex machine learning techniques, such as Recurrent Neural Networks, Attention, or Transformer-based models that better capture long-term dependencies within time-series data.

3. Ensemble Approaches:
   
Training of multiple models; for instance, Random Forest, SVM, LSTM, and combining them into an ensemble approach, improving the accuracy of predictions through exploring the strengths of each individual model.

4. Model Tuning:

Optimization techniques such as grid search or random search are used on models to fine-tune them so that predictability is enhanced.
Market Anomaly Detection: Models designed for anomaly or shock detection in financial markets would be useful for predicting the movement of markets, such as crashes or surges. This would then be used to design better risk management strategies.



### CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the project aimed to predict stock market trends using time series analysis and machine learning. It evaluated the performance of different machine learning models, including ARIMA, and other Machine learning models, and compared their results.
The use of time series analysis allowed us to identify patterns and trends in the stock market data, which were then used to train machine learning models. This approach is used to develop models that could accurately predict future stock prices based on historical data.
