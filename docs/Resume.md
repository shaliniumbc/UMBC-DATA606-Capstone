### Academic Projects

**Malicious Object and Crime Object Detection in Public places using Deep learning**  
*Anurag Group of Institution*  
*April 2020 – May 2021*

This project aims to detect malicious objects and crime-related items in public areas using the **YOLO V3** deep learning model. YOLO (You Only Look Once) provides real-time object detection by processing images and videos quickly and accurately. The model was trained on a custom dataset to recognize potentially dangerous items, enhancing public safety monitoring. The solution is designed for integration into surveillance systems for immediate threat detection.

** Machine Learning Model for Predicting Stock Prices** 
 Built and deployed a machine learning model using Python and Scikit-learn to predict stock prices.

** Los Angeles Crime Data from 2020 to Present using Machine Learning**
This project uses various machine-learning techniques to analyze Los Angeles crime data from 2020 to the present. The goal is to predict crime trends and classify crime types based on historical data.

**Car Accident Severity Analysis**

This project analyzes car accident severity using data from the UK Government website. The data was stored in **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)** for scalable and fault-tolerant storage. **PySpark** and **SQL** were employed for efficient data processing, leveraging distributed computing for large datasets. We used various **machine learning algorithms** to predict accident severity, aiming to enhance safety and risk assessment. Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Sweetviz**, and **Plotly** to present insightful trends and patterns in the data.
