## Background

### What is it about?

The project aims to enhance stock market predictions using machine learning techniques. Stock market forecasts have always been very speculative, based on historical trends, financial news, and expert opinions. Machine learning is a powerful tool for making more accurate and efficient predictions about how stock prices will evolve. It can process large amounts of data and discover hidden trends.

### Why does it matter?

Accurate stock market predictions significantly benefit investors, financial experts, and hedge funds. Predictive accuracy can help with investment strategies, risk management, and general financial decision-making. Furthermore, given the dynamic and turbulent nature of stock markets, applying machine learning provides a modern method for addressing these challenges in a more data-driven approach.


### Research Questions?

1. Can machine learning models outperform traditional statistical methods in stock market prediction?
2. What are the key features that most significantly impact stock price movements?
3. How does the time horizon (short-term vs. long-term prediction) affect model accuracy?
